# Codewars
All my Codewars solutions for PHP/SQL/JS Kata, all these solutions work when I push them, but maybe in the future the Kata will be modified and some of my solutions will not work. And maybe I'm not using the best way in my solutions.

Feel free to add your solutions in any language, try to use the same folder structure (Language/Level/File) and name the files in UpperCamelCase, please respect PSR2 rules if you make PHP katas
